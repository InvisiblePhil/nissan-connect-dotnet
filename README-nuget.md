# Nissan Connect Client Library

[![CI](https://github.com/hagronnestad/nissan-connect-dotnet/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/hagronnestad/nissan-connect-dotnet/actions/workflows/main.yml) [![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/NissanConnectLib)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NissanConnectLib)

***Unofficial*** C# .NET client library for the Nissan Connect API. This library is based on the great [dartnissanconnect](https://gitlab.com/tobiaswkjeldsen/dartnissanconnect)-library by [@Tobiaswk](https://github.com/Tobiaswk).

⚠️ This library supports the EU-region only. (I think?)
